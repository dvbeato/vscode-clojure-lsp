# vscode-clojure-lsp

it's a try to evolve client-vscode POC from [https://github.com/snoe/clojure-lsp](https://github.com/snoe/clojure-lsp)

this plugin will give [extra capabilities](https://github.com/snoe/clojure-lsp#capabilities) to your clojure development without the need to start a calva REPL.

It's not a replacement for calva, but just a complement.
